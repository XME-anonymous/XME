and install the dependencies:

    $ python -m venv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    (env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Data

You can download the data needed for this project from
[this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BFthZvNEgCZ1Nt35nGCDYLwXVK7Y7as1?usp=sharing).
Download the dataset and change the path in the `run.py` with the path of the dataset where it is downloaded
